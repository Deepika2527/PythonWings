Varaibles - 
Which hold a data or it is an identifer which holds a values
 

 why??
 To store the value and we can use it.
 We cn perform some opertaions
 it allocates some memory


syntax:
variable_name = varaible_value;

name = 'Anu';
course = 'Python'
a =5



remember- All the Varaibles can be an identifier but not all the identifiers can be varaibles



Constant - Captial letters
indentation- In default python is going to provide spaces those are called block
in js


1tab or 4spaces


so it says which statement belong to which block- where the block start and ends.

for(){

}
in python

def greet():
     print('Hello')
greet()

if age>18:
print("Hello your are 18")
