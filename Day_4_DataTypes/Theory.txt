Datatype:
Datatypes is nothing butb what type of data is being assigned to a varible is called datatype

why:
to save the storage in the meory
to know what kind of data does the varibles holds
we can perform operations
we can also modify



types of Datatypes

primitive-
single values(scalar), which are immutable 

int - integer/intergeral - whole number , +ve and -ve values, no precision 
wher - age, salary, max-limit,
float - which has decimal values - . , 3.14, 45666.67 - Electronic
complex - 3 + 5j  - left(real), right(imaginary)
boolean- bool - True, False -  1's and 0's


Non primitive-
There are hetergenous, mutable
these are again classified into the following..
Sequentical datatypes - index (basically start from 0)


string-  


' ' , " " , ''' '''

list - [], mutable, indexes, hetergenous, order, duplicates are allowed
tuple - (), hetergenous, index, cant modify, immutable, ordered, duplicated


non sequetical datatypes- set - these cant be acessed by indexes
{}, no index values, but we can add the add the data/ remove ,we cant modified, hetergenous

dict - key-value pairs - 


id-   memory allocation
type-
sys.sizeof()
