1. What is a programming Language?


Language : It is process where the person's can exchange their thoughts
program - set of instructions that are give to the system

To build the bridge between the person and the machine we have compiler and interpreter.



Languages are classified into 2 types.


Low - Machine level language, Assembly
High -  python, java, javascript, php.....

compiler based languages - c, c++...
interpreter based languages - javascript, php
Hybrid - Compiler + interpreter - python,java


What is Python?
Easy to learn  a = 10 , print()
syntax is very Easy
Scripting lanaguage- Automation,
High level lanaguage
Hybrid language - 
Platform Independent
Dymanically Typed Language
General purpose -
Data Centric-
programming Pradagims


History Python- 

Introduce by Guddio van Rossum, offically it was introduced in the year 1991.
He named it as Python after watching a Tv show - Monty Python show.




What is a hybrid Language?
Combination of interpreter and Compiler


Compiler     ???                               

 Recipe-->> written in French
 Translating that Enitre french recipe into english - compiled(Google/Chatgpt)
English Script- start cooking 



one time compiled
if no errors then the code will execute
Independent


interpreter ????
 Recipe-->> written in French
  Translating that french recipe line by line to english - youtube/Friend(Intrepretter)
  You will work along with that...


n times
it runs till the code where there are no errors
Dependent

  //coding
sourcecode- whichn is wriiten b y us
 //for example if it c language
 
sourcecode(.c) ------>>  compiler(.exc)-----> binary


//python - Bytecode, RunTimeEnviorment, PVM

sourcecode(.py)--->compiler ByteCode(.pyc)--->Python Virtual Machine (Binary Code)--->>RunTimeEnviorment(OutPut)

What is PlatformIndependent?


what is platform?-->OPERATING STYSTEM

Windows           Mac              Linux

for c -- write the code .c -->compiled code .exc  -->> output
The complied code for c cant be run of other Os which are compiled on one Os...


but coming to Python.....

compiler ByteCode(.pyc)-  window---->mac---->Linux  =>PlatformIndependent

Dymanically Typed Language?
 
a = 10;
b = "Hello"
  the datatype is defined by the runtime expilcitly...




  General purpose - Desktop appl, webdevelopment, gaming,


  Data Centric - Has vast Libraries - Numpy,pandas, seaborm..
    Datascience,
    ML & AL,
    DA...


    Paradigm means style of programming - 

    Procedular - 
    Functional - function
    Modular -  groups of functions is called modules..
    Ooops -   data, methods, objects


    Python Libraries/modules

    Desktop App- Tkinter, pyside
    webdevelopment - django,flask
    Games - Pygame,para 3d
    Database - SQLlite, PyMySql
    Ds - Numy,pandas,Tensor flow,
